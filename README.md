## âœ´ Staranise Browser  

A simple, to-the-point, no-bloat web browser. As honest and as barebone as it can be.

Staranise is an Electron app bootstraped using a [fork of electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/shonsirsha/electron-react-boilerplate), with the standard Electron replaced by an [Electron fork by castlabs (castLabs Electron for Content Security)](https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases).
